# Using Git Push
The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.
When we push, the remote(Github) will have the newest changes that we created on our machine.

In your project, run the following command
```git push```

Run git status again and you should see the message, 'Your branch is up to date with...' which mean both our local machine
and GitHub now have the exact same copy of codes
