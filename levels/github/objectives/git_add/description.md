# Using Git Add
The command ``git add`` is used to add file(s) for tracking as part of the staging changes.

On the terminal, inside your Octocat2TheMoon project run the following command ``git add --all`` to add all files
in the project as part of the tracking for staging changes. Alternatively, if you prefer to add the files individually
you may do so by using the command ``git add [file name]``

After you have added the files, check git status again
```git status```

You should see the status changes from Untracked files to Changes to be committed
