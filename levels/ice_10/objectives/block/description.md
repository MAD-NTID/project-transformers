# Block Statements
A block statement is a sequence of zero or more statements enclosed in braces. A block statement is generally used to group together several statements, so they can be used in a situation that requires you to use a single statement. In some situations, you can use only one statement. If you want to use more than one statement in those situations, you can create a block statement by placing all your statements inside braces, which would be treated as a single statement. You can think of a block statement as a compound statement that is treated as one statement.
