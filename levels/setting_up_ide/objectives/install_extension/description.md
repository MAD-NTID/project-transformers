# Install C# Extension for Visual Studio Code
The features that Visual Studio Code includes out-of-the-box are just the start. VS Code extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow. VS Code's rich extensibility model lets extension authors plug directly into the VS Code UI and contribute functionality through the same APIs used by VS Code. This article explains how to find, install, and manage VS Code extensions from the 
[Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode).

For this exercise, you will be adding the C# Extension to visual studio code from the marketplace.
