# Install Visual Studio Code (VSC)
In order to write codes, we will need an IDE.

Integrated development environments (IDE) are applications that facilitates the development of other applications. Designed to encompass all programming tasks in one application, one of the main benefits of an IDE is that they offer a central interface with all the tools a developer needs, including:
- Code editor: Designed for writing and editing source code, these editors are distinguished from text editors because work to either simplify or enhance the process of writing and editing of code for developers
- Compiler: Compilers transform source code that is written in a human readable/writable language in a form that computers can execute.
- Debugger: Debuggers are used during testing and can help developers debug their application programs.
- Build automation tools: These can help automate developer tasks that are more common to save time.

For this course, we will use Visual Studio Code. You can read more about Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/whyvscode)
