2. Create a new project called **SimpleInputs** in the repository using the dotnet command
3. cd into the SimpleInputs project
4. Delete the Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
5. Prompt the user for their full name
6. Store the name in a variable with the appropriate type
7. Prompt the user for their age
8. Store the age in a variable with the appropriate type
9. Perform a simple calculation with the age that the user will be in 5 years time and store the result in a variable
10. Display the following information back to the console
```
    Hello <name>,
    You are <age> and in 5 years time you will be <age in 5 years time>
```
