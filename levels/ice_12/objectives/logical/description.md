In c#, Logical Operators are useful to perform the logical operation between two operands like AND, OR, and NOT based on our requirements. The Logical Operators will always work with Boolean expressions (true or false) and return Boolean values.



The operands in logical operators must always contain only Boolean values. Otherwise, Logical Operators will throw an error.
