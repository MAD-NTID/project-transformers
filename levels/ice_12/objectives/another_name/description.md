# Conditional Statements
Conditional statements are used through the various programming languages to instruct the computer on the decision to make when given some conditions. These decisions are made if and only if the pre-stated conditions are either true or false, depending on the functions the programmer has in mind.

All programming languages have conditional expression syntax (although the syntax slightly differs from one programming language to the others).
