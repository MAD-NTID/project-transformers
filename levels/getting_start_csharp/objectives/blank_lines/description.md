# Adding Spaces

<div class="aside">
<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add space to your console output</li>
</ul>
</div>

Modify your program to display by including blank lines around it such as

```text
====blank line====
Hello Nerds/Geeks!!--- I'm <first name> <last name>
====blank line====
I am from the best hometown in the USA, <hometown>!
====blank line====
```

Please notice that ====blank line==== should not be included in your program as text, it is just an for you to
know where the space should be.

Hint: Can you use Console.WriteLine to accomplish this?
