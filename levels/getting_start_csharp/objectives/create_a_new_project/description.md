</ul>
</div>

Open the terminal to your prefer location on your system and create a new project called WorkingWithVisualStudioCode.

You will need to remember this location as you will need to supply the path as part of the challenge. I recommend that 
you create a specific folder to store all activities that you do in this course in one specific location.

Once you have selected the preferred location, run this command to create the project

```
    dotnet new console -n WorkingWithVisualStudioCode
```

The command above will create a C# project in a folder called WorkingWithVisualStudioCode on your selected location on
the computer.

After you have created the project, open the project in VSC and modify the program so that the console will display example below
on the screen.

```text
Hello Nerds/Geeks!!--- I'm <first name> <last name>
```

Hint: What C#'s statement is used to show something in the console's window?
