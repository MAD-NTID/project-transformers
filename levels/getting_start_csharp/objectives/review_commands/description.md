In this exercise, you will be reviewing the dotnet commands. It is essential that you understand how to run the commands.
The .NET command-line interface (CLI) is a cross-platform toolchain for developing, building, running, and publishing .NET applications.

In this course, we will be using VSC as our main IDE. There are two ways to run our program:
- We could run it by clicking the run tab on VSC
- We could use the dotnet command

To see the list of all available commands for dotnet, you can run the following command
```dotnet -h```


Generally, -h or --help stands for help and often "help" you know how to use the commands or simply let
you know what options are available for a particular command.
