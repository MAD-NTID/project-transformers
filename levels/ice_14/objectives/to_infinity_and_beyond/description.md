# Counting down with infinite loop and break.

You have been hired by Star Command to help build the code that will launch Buzz Lightyear into 
infinity and beyond.

Your job will be to program the countdown sequence of the rocket. According to your 
manager, you need to allow Buzz to enter the value to start counting down from.
After Buzz entered the starting number for the countdown, the countdown must
begin using an infinite loop. Once the countdown has print the 0, it must break out
of the loop and launch the rocket.

Step
- Create a new project called **ToInfinityAndBeyond**
- Create the countdown using an infinite loop and break based on the requirements above.
