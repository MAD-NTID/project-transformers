# Part 3 - Working with Input and Simple Array

## Objective
For this assignment, you will be writing a program that takes 5 family member names, store them in an array,then display those names
back to the user. You are to complete this assignment without using any loop. A simple index variable or hardcoded the index for each member
will be sufficient for this exercise.

Remember to test your program little by little as you do your work. Small testing is better than
test everything at the end.

## Step
1. Create a new project called **ArrayInputSimple**
2. Prompt the user for their name
```
Enter your name: Kemoy Campbell
```
3. store the name in a variable with the appropriate data type
4. Prompt the user for 5 family member's name, each inputs must be on a separate line Eg:
```
Enter the name of the first family member:Nevaeh Hoffman
Enter the name of the second family member:Callum Stokes
Enter the name of the third family member:Adelyn White 
Enter the name of the fourth family member:Alice Harrison
Enter the name of the fifth family member:Brynlee Mitchell
```

4. For each of the family member entered, store their name in an array at the proper location. ***Hint: You can create an index variable that you increment each
time you add a new family member.***
5. Display the result back to the user similar to the screenshot below:
```
Hello Kemoy Campbell,

The name of your family members are:
Nevaeh Hoffman
Callum Stokes
Adelyn White
Alice Harrison
Brynlee Mitchell
```

Make sure your program works then save and push your changes to github
