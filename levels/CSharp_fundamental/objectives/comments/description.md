# Comments in C#

Comments can be used to document what the program does and what specific blocks or lines of code do. Since the C# compiler ignores comments, you can include them anywhere in a program without affecting your code.

How to comment?

A comment is preceded by an double forward slash. The code of line after the double forward slash is simply ignored by the compiler.

We have following types of comments in C#:

***Single Line Comment***

``//for single line comments``

***Multiple Line/ Block Comments***

``/* for multi line comments */  ``
