# Grade Letter and Grading Scale
Each college/course have their own grading scale. It is important that you
read the grading scale below and understand what letter each grade represented.

In NMAD-180, you will need a 75%(C) in order to be able to take NMAD-181 and other MAD related courses.

| Average                                      | Grade                             |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 94.0% - 100%                                 | A                                 |
| 90.0% - 93.9%                                | A-                                |

| 75.0% - 77.9%                                | C                                 |
| <span style="color:red">70.0% - 74.9%</span> | <span style="color:red">D </span> |
| <span style="color:red">Less than 70%</span> | <span style="color:red">F</span>  |



## Note
```
Ranges for letter grades of “C,” “D,” and “F” are different from what is frequently used in
other courses. Further, be aware that you must have a letter grade of “C” or better (as
defined above) to continue to the next programming course (NMAD-181 Programming
Fundamentals II: Mobile Domain)
```

# Rounding of Final Grade
Rounding of your final grade is at the discretion of your instructor. A grade value may only be rounded to the
next highest whole number. 
```
For example, a final grade of 88.75 may be rounded up to 89 but NOT to 90. All
decisions to round grades are final
