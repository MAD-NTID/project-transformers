In order to pass this course, there are certain requirements that needs to be satisfied.

## In Class Exercises (ICE)

The following policies apply to in-class exercise:
- ICE are due at the beginning of the **next class**.
- You are expected to make serious attempted on all ICE assignments. They are designed to help you understand
the lectures. In most case, students who failed to completed the ICE often struggle with  the course.

Homework assignments will be assigned each week. THe following information applies to homework assignments:
- Unlike ICE, homework assignments are more challenging and will require more effort than ICE assignments
- Homework assignments are graded on a 0-100 scale unless specified otherwise

    Homework assignments must be done independently. Collaboration with other students on
    a assignments(e.g, by sharing your work) is a violation of academic integrity policy and
