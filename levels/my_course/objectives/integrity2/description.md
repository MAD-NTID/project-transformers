## What is academic integrity?
Simply put, academic integrity is ["the expectation that teachers, students research and all members of the academic community

## ICS department academic integrity policies
The Department of Information and Computing Studies (ICS) has zero tolerance for any form of
academic dishonesty. Any action deemed dishonest as defined within this document or the RIT Code of
Conduct will be addressed as described below and in accordance with RIT and NTID policies. This
statement of policy applies to students participating in courses offered by the Information and
Computing Studies department regardless of their “home” department and may differ from that of
other departments.

## Definition and Category of academic integrity according to RIT policy
In accordance with RIT and departmental policy, Academic Integrity falls within (but is not limited to) the
following four (4) categories:
1. **CHEATING**

      Knowingly using, buying, stealing, transporting, or soliciting (in whole or in part) the contents of
      an administered or unadministered test/examination, test key, homework solution, research/
      report paper, project, software project, computer program, or any other assignment. In
      addition, cheating includes using, accessing, stealing, altering, or gaining entry to information
      held in a computer account, a network, cloud, personal storage area, or on a physical storage
      device


2. **Collusion**

   The unauthorized collaboration with another person in preparing written or computer work
   (including electronic media) offered for credit. Any work you submit must be your own.
   Working with a friend or group on an assignment is expressly forbidden unless it is explicitly
   designated as a group project.
   There is a second form of collusion called passive or indirect collusion. Passive collusion is the
   result of posting coursework solutions or course materials to a publicly accessible space allowing
   others to anonymously take advantage of your work. 

    These spaces include, but are not limited to:
   - Social media services such as Facebook, Instagram, etc.,
   - Communication services such as Slack, Teams, Discord, etc.,
   - Publicly-accessible, personal or organization (e.g., club) web pages,
   - Organizational repositories (physical or electronic) such as those that may be supported
     by fraternities, sororities, specialized student housing (for example, Computer Science
     House, Engineering House, Photo House, etc.),
   - Public access spaces on version management systems such as GitHub, etc.,
   - On-line homework solution services,
   - Physical forms such as bulletin boards, classrooms, etc.

    In the event that materials from multiple courses are posted, each course’s posting will be
     treated as a separate incident.

    ```
    Note:
   
    If course-related materials are posted by a student after he/she/they completes a
    course and receives a grade, the department chairperson, in consultation with the
    faculty member for the course involved, will decide upon any disciplinary action to be
    taken.
   ```
3. **PLAGIARISM**

   As defined in the RIT Student Academic Integrity Policy, [“Plagiarism is the representation of
   others' ideas as one's own without giving proper attribution to the original author or authors.
   Plagiarism occurs when a student copies direct phrases from a text (e.g., books, journals, and
   internet) and does not provide quotation marks or paraphrases or summarizes those ideas
   without giving credit to the author or authors. In all cases, if such information is not properly
   and accurately documented with appropriate credit given, then the student has committed
   plagiarism.”](http://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/d080)

4. DUPLICATE SUBMISSION

   Duplicate submission when the student submits the same or similar work for credit in more than
   one course **without prior approval of the instructor(s)** for those courses.
